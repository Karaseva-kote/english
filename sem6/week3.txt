Hi Anna,

I am so sorry to have missed the deadline for creating last mathematical algorithm. I realize I have put the rest of the team in a terrible position. 

This happened because the last algorithm turned out to be more complex than I expected, and I had to spend more time understanding it. But now I consulted with my colleagues and solved this problem, so I've expect to have my portion of work by end this week. I have already completed two other mathematical algorithms.

I want to do everything I can to keep you in the loop and to make up for this inconvenience. 

Kate
