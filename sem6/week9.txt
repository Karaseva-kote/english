Hi, Anna

I am writing you a letter to inform you about the current progress of our project. most of the work has been completed, but we are currently busy fixing problems with last mathematical algorithm. we have already consulted with colleagues on this issue, so the correction will not take much time and the project will be finished by the deadline.

Kate
